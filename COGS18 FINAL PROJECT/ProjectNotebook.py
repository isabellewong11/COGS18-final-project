# # Project Description

# For my final project, I decided to become a chatbot myself. The user is able to be my friend and have a conversation with me, as we make plans to hang out later. The user likewise has the opportunity to guess some of my favorite things, in order to get to know me better. This project is meant to simulate a real conversation with me, as I put my genuine responses and preferences in the code. 
# 
# So, let's chat below and become friends!

# ## Project Code
# 
# If it makes sense for your project, you can have code and outputs here in the notebook as well.

# Before this quarter, my only experience with coding was the fundamentals that I learned in COGS3. Being a communications major, I haven't been able to expose myself to coding during my UCSD education, but I had always wanted to try. I excited to take this class as a prereq for a class for my design minor, and am happy with how well I've done this quarter.
# 
# I wanted to do the final project to challenge myself and create a working project from scratch, and I was confident enough to do so, as I'm extremely proud of my current A+ in this class. During the CL's and the assignments, I found myself sometimes just following directions for a question, without fully attempting to understand what each function did or why it was important. This project forced me to actually think for myself and understand how each function operates as part of a whole, because most functions within this project are co-dependent on one or another in order to successfully operate. I spent a significant amount of time debugging and trying to understand some lines of code, and am happy with how my chatbot turned out.
